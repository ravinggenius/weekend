## IsItTheWeekendYet?

Count down to Friday at 17:00 or Monday at 08:00, whichever is closer to the user's local time.

### Setup / Installation

This project uses [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [roots](http://roots.cx/) ([NPM](https://npmjs.org/package/roots)), so you will need to set those up. After you have the `roots` command-line tool, run `roots watch` to start a development server (this also opens a browser) and `roots compile` to build the site.
